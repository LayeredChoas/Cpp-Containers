# Cpp-Containers

The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. To make sure you understand them all, let's re-implement them!

- MultiMap
- Stack
- Queue
- Deque

## Usage

```bash
clang++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra $CONTAINER_NAME/*.cpp ($CONTAINER_NAME)_main.cpp -o  $CONTAINER_NAME
```
